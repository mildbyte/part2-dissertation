     abstract = {Topic models, such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA), can be useful tools for the statistical analysis of document collections and other discrete data. The LDA model assumes that the words of each document arise from a mixture of topics, each of which is a distribution over the vocabulary. A limitation of LDA is the inability to model topic correlation even though, for example, a document about genetics is more likely to also be about disease than X-ray astronomy. This limitation stems from the use of the Dirichlet distribution to model the variability among the topic proportions. In this paper we develop the correlated topic model (CTM), where the topic proportions exhibit correlation via the logistic normal distribution [J. Roy. Statist. Soc. Ser. B 44 (1982) 139-177]. We derive a fast variational inference algorithm for approximate posterior inference in this model, which is complicated by the fact that the logistic normal is not conjugate to the multinomial. We apply the CTM to the articles from Science published from 1990-1999, a data set that comprises 57M words. The CTM gives a better fit of the data than LDA, and we demonstrate its use as an exploratory tool of large document collections.},

abstract  ="Drug treatments often perturb the activities of certain pathways{,} sets of functionally related genes. Examining pathways/gene sets that are responsive to drug treatments instead of a simple list of regulated genes can advance our understanding about such cellular processes after perturbations. In general{,} pathways do not work in isolation and their connections can cause secondary effects. To address this{,} we present a new method to better identify pathway responsiveness to drug treatments and simultaneously to determine between-pathway interactions. Firstly{,} we developed a Bayesian matrix factorisation of gene expression data together with known gene-pathway memberships to identify pathways perturbed by drugs. Secondly{,} in order to determine the interactions between pathways{,} we implemented a Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF) under the matrix factorization framework. Assuming a Gaussian distribution of pathway responsiveness{,} we calculated the correlations between pathways. We applied the combination of the Bayesian factor model and the GMRF to analyse gene expression data of 1169 drugs with 236 known pathways{,} 66 of which were disease-related pathways. Our model yielded a significantly higher average precision than the existing methods for identifying pathway responsiveness to drugs that affected multiple pathways. This implies the advantage of the between-pathway interactions and confirms our assumption that pathways are not independent{,} an aspect that has been commonly overlooked in the existing methods. Additionally{,} we demonstrate four case studies illustrating that the between-pathway network enhances the performance of pathway identification and provides insights into disease comorbidity{,} drug repositioning{,} and tissue-specific comparative analysis of drug treatments."}
