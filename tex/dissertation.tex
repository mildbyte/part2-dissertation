\chapter{Introduction}

Topic models come from the realm of natural language processing and are bag-of-words models that allow for exploratory data analysis on collections of documents. They assume that documents in a corpus are generated by first drawing a distribution of topics for every document, then picking words for a document by first choosing a topic from this distribution and then sampling a word from that distribution.

Using topic models in order to predict pathways affected by drugs has many benefits. Firstly, pathways that a new drug is likely to affect can be predicted without having to perform tests on real people, which means that useless drugs can be rejected quicker. In addition, this kind of analysis can allow researchers to find new uses (affected pathways) for existing drugs. Finally, the inferred correlation matrix can provide useful insights into relationships between pathways (such as disease comorbidity).

\section{Training process}

Probably a feedback picture with variational parameters and model parameters here.
\input{variational_inference}

The core of the training process is optimizing the likelihood bound on the model: how likely is the corpus given the model. By altering the parameters of the model in order to maximize this bound, the model is trained on the data.

The training happens in cycles. First, a variational distribution is fit to every document in the corpus. Then, the new model parameters are inferred and the likelihood bound recalculated. This process repeats until changes in the likelihood bound are negligible.

\section{Incorporating priors into the Model}

In the training process, observe that:

This means that a zero entry in the $\beta$ matrix that the training process is initialized with will carry through to the variational parameters for every document and will be fed back into the updated $\beta$, thus enforcing that the inferred per-topic word distributions have zeros in the set places. This has the effect of setting pathway-gene membership priors and ensures that the inferred topic structure is referring to the actual pathways, so the results of the inference process will allow us to make judgements about real-world phenomena.

\section{Classification process}

TODO: read up on how theta is inferred

\section{Implementation in code}

Python!

\section{Code optimization}

Since Python is an interpreted language, it is great for quick prototyping and implementation. Unfortunately, it means that its performance is several orders of magnitude is several orders of magnitude below that of C code. Using NumPy for numerical calculations definitely helps, since the matrix product operations are performed in native code, but I still had performance issues which would have made working with the actual KEGG/CMap datasets very inconvenient. The training time for 1/10th of the dataset was about 3-4 hours, which implies more than 30-40 hours for the full dataset, since increasing its size would worsen the convergence rate. Using the profiler, I identified several performance bottlenecks in the code.

Firstly, the EM process used explicit list comprehensions -> converted into dot products

Another major bottleneck is the likelihood bound calculation, which has to be performed every variational inference cycle for every document, since the termination criterion is based on the magnitude of changes in the bound. One solution to this would be not calculating the likelihood bound every iteration, but this resulted in worse performance: another variational inference cycle was more expensive than checking the bound. I used \texttt{numexpr}, a package that compiles operations on \texttt{NumPy} arrays into its own internal virtual machine bytecode and supports multithreaded computations on arrays.

The variational inference process requires calling the \texttt{SciPy} function minimizer for some parameters multiple times, which requires an initial value to start its search from. It turned out that in the beginning of the variational inference (every EM iteration) the initial values were the default ones. Recycling the variational parameters to continue the search from the previous iteration gave yet another performance improvement.

Also, precalculating some often-used values (inverse sigma, sparse phi etc)

I also recompiled my \texttt{NumPy} distribution to use the Intel Math Kernel Library as its backend. Free for academic and personal use, Intel MKL provides a linear algebra library that implements the BLAS (Basic Linear Algebra Subsystem) API, optimized for manycore Intel CPUs.

Since the variational inference process is independent for every document, it can be parallelized across multiple cores. However, because of the Python Global Interpreter Lock, only one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time. This meant that I had to launch several Python processes if I wanted to take advantage of my CPU's capabilities. While this did provide an increase in CPU usage, it resulted in worse performance than using \texttt{numxepr} and Intel MKL's natural multithreading capabilities.

These efforts brought the training time down to about 8-9 hours for the whole dataset.

\chapter{Evaluation}

\section{Toy datasets}

Since it is difficult to verify correctness of the model on the real drug dataset, I had to write some routines for toy dataset generation of various complexities.

\begin{itemize}
\item Sample $\mu$ from a K-dimensional uniform distribution
\item Sample $\beta$ from K voclen-dimensional uniform distributions and normalize it
\item Sample $\Sigma$ from an inverse Wishart distribution
\item Generate N random documents
\end{itemize}

The generation process returns the model parameters, the counts of words in each document, as well as the topic distribution for every document. Only the word counts are fed into the model: the other outputs are used for evaluation.

The big problem in the evaluation of the model is topic identifiability: the recovered topics are not at all guaranteed to be in the correct order and if they are close together, they are not guaranteed to be recovered. To combat this, the entries on the diagonal of the $\beta$ matrix are set to zero: that way every topic has a missing word.

The performance measure that is not affected by the topic identifiability is the document similarity matrix. Given the inferred and the reference $\theta$, the per-document topic distribution, we can take their cosine similarity to see how similar any two documents are. Thus, for the whole corpus, we can construct a document similarity matrix and the two matrices for the inferred and the reference distributions can be compared.

To see how well the topic structure has been recovered, a similar matrix can be constructed for $\beta$, the per-topic word distribution. Using this matrix, we can see which topics from the inferred structure are the closest to the original ones and permute the results of the model accordingly, giving us access to more evaluation measures.

Perhaps vary K and the vocabulary length to plot a grid of RMSEs, also add the CDF from some sample tests.

\section{KEGG and CMap datasets}
